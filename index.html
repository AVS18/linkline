                    <p>
                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The past decade has been a wake-up call for almost every country on earth, natural disasters and calamities have increased at an unprecedented rate in every country in the world. Experts in the field attribute this change in the climate and the ecological balance to the rapidly developing industries and pollution from the same. One of the main contributors to this pollution is the automotive industry that burns gasoline and diesel to power vehicles used by almost everybody on earth. Realising that burning these fuels and releasing carbon and other polluting substances into the atmosphere will lead to our inevitable doom, the automotive industry started looking into alternative sources of energy to power vehicles for transportation.<br><br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The leading contender in the race is electric energy. Over the past decade, we have seen great advancements in the field of battery technology and electric motors that have brought Electric Vehicles (EV) closer to feasibility than ever before. One of the main issues that plagued the EV industry is the widespread existence of range anxiety. People are concerned that an EV might leave them stranded in the middle of nowhere if they take it on a long drive. In the case of gasoline or diesel-powered car, if you run out of fuel, you could walk to a gas station and purchase a bottle of fuel to pour into the fuel tank and have the car drive to the fuel station. While in an EV you would have to call a tow truck to come and tow the vehicle to the charging station where it would have to spend a few hours to regain the charge while the fuel-powered cars can have their complete range restored in a matter of minutes. Another issue that consumers fear is the extended charging times needed in order to completely replenish the battery. While petrol or diesel-powered car can go from 0 to a few hundred kilometres of range in a matter of minutes, an EV would take at least an hour even with the most advanced charging systems out there. <br><br>

                    <p>
                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Tesla, one of the most leading companies in battery technology and the automotive industry has pioneered a wide variety of solutions to the issues that the customers fear and which in turn lead to hesitation in purchasing an electric vehicle. Unlike the initial years when an EV battery was inherently a very large lead-acid battery where the range and charging were both poor, the modern cars come with a lithium-ion battery that is capable of long-range travel and faster-charging speeds. Tesla uses individual Lithium-ion cells to power their vehicles, it’s basically hundreds of normal batteries that are found in daily use items like TV remote stacked together to form a large battery. This helps in repair and increases the durability of the entire battery. <br><br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;There have been many experiments by different manufacturers to figure out how to make mass consumer EV which can be daily driven and taken on long trips without the fear being stranded. Some of the concepts being investigated or hybrid engines where a small displacement gas powered engine is aided by an electric motor to increase performance and efficiency, another concept being investigated is the idea of swapping batteries at stations to instantly regain drivable range. This concept quickly met a roadblock when they realised it would require standardising the shape size and specification of all batteries in all electric vehicles, deeming this concept not feasible. One of the other solutions adopted on a large scale is the use of high power DC charging. Conventional chargers use an AC to DC converter onboard the vehicle to charge the car, while DC chargers do the conversion outside allowing for larger converters which can produce more power. This technology is still in its infancy and isn’t widespread enough to assure the consumers of worry free travel. <br><br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A major change brought on by the adoption of Electric vehicles that most people overlook is the change in the structure of the car. The heavy battery that is located so close to the ground leads to a low centre of gravity that leads to improved stability around a corner. The increased weight will also require the chassis to be stronger leading to a more stronger body that can will lead to more safety. Currently with the advancements of battery technology and DC charging, widespread use of electric vehicles is definitely the future of personal transportation and is expected to be adopted completely within the next few decades. <br><br>

Along with that, the Execom needed to understand about the awards and funds provided by IEEE. That is, giving a deep insight into the activities held at all levels of the organization.<br></p> 
                            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The delegates who participated in the program were introduced by any of the members of LINK Team . Then the speaker dives into deeper topics such as email and telephone etiquettes, beginning from defining what an OU is. Queries were taken from the volunteer leaders then, and were rectified by the speaker. For further contact details of the LINK/MD team were given for the support.  <br></p>
                            <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The event stretched about 1.5-2 hours,  concluded with a small interactive session at the end. Total 20 Execom Training Sessions have been conducted so far.  <br></p>
