                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The past decade has been a wake-up call for almost every country on earth, natural disasters and calamities have increased at an unprecedented rate in every country in the world. Experts in the field attribute this change in the climate and the ecological balance to the rapidly developing industries and pollution from the same. One of the main contributors to this pollution is the automotive industry that burns gasoline and diesel to power vehicles used by almost everybody on earth. Realising that burning these fuels and releasing carbon and other polluting substances into the atmosphere will lead to our inevitable doom, the automotive industry started looking into alternative sources of energy to power vehicles for transportation.<br><br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The leading contender in the race is electric energy. Over the past decade, we have seen great advancements in the field of battery technology and electric motors that have brought Electric Vehicles (EV) closer to feasibility than ever before. One of the main issues that plagued the EV industry is the widespread existence of range anxiety. People are concerned that an EV might leave them stranded in the middle of nowhere if they take it on a long drive. In the case of gasoline or diesel-powered car, if you run out of fuel, you could walk to a gas station and purchase a bottle of fuel to pour into the fuel tank and have the car drive to the fuel station. While in an EV you would have to call a tow truck to come and tow the vehicle to the charging station where it would have to spend a few hours to regain the charge while the fuel-powered cars can have their complete range restored in a matter of minutes. Another issue that consumers fear is the extended charging times needed in order to completely replenish the battery. While petrol or diesel-powered car can go from 0 to a few hundred kilometres of range in a matter of minutes, an EV would take at least an hour even with the most advanced charging systems out there. <br><br>
